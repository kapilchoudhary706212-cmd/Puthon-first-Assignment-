        "Q1.  What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "\n",
        "ans:- python is high-level languag developed by gudio van Rossun in the year of 1991 it is ease for readability and write . and it is popular for web dovelopement , data science and machin learing due to simple synteax and libaries and strog community support.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2.  What is an interpreter in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:- Interpreter are the computer programing that will covert to source code High-level languag into intermediate code(machine level language) it is also called translator in programing terminology.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3.  What are pre-defined keywords in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:- pre-defined keyword in python are reserved words theat have special meaning and functionalities with in the language.\n",
        "Ex:- # if , if else, if elif else\n",
        "     # for loops and while loops\n",
        "     # operatiors\n",
        "     # error handling are the pre defined keywors in python\n",

        "Q4. Can Keyword be used an variabls name ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:- # value keywords - true, false ,name\n",
        "      # operator keywords - and, or, not is, in\n",
        "      # control keywords - If , else, elif,for,while\n",

        "Q5. What is mutability in pythone\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:- In python mutability refers to the ability of an object to be modified agter it has been created.\n",
        "Ex:- common mutable data type in Python\n",
        "     . list\n",
        "     . dict\n",
        "     . set\n",
        "\n",
        "Q6. why are list mutable , but tuples are immutables\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:- Tuples and list are the same in every way but tuples use parentheses instead of square bracket and the item in tuples cannot be changed but items in list can be changed . call list mutable ( meaning they can be changed) and tuples immutables (meaning they can not be changed).\n",
        "\n",
        "Q7. What is the difference between \"==\" and \"is\" operators in pythone ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:- In python \"==\" and is operators are both usedd for comparison but they seave different purposes the == operator checks for equality of value which means it evaluates whether the values two object are the same on the other hand is operator check for identy meening determines whether two variables point to the same object in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q8. What is logical operotors in Pythone ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:- Logical operators in Pythons are used to combine conditional statements and evaluate expressions the result in a boolean value (true and false)\n",
        "\n",
        "Ex:- and ,Or, Not, is a logical operators\n",
        "\n",
        "Q9. What is type casting in python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:- Type casting is the method to convert the python varible data type into a certain data type in order to perform the required opration by user.\n",
        "Ex:- int(), str(), flot(), bool()\n",
        "\n",
        "Q10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:- Implicit and explicit type casting also know as type cover-sion are methods of changing a variable data type Implicit casting or widening happens automaticallly when a smaller data type to a larag one without the pro-grammer heeding to specify it.\n",
        "      Explicit type casting or requires the programmer to explicity state the desired data type coversion which may involve potential data loss.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q11. What is the purpose of conditional statments in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:- Conditional Statement in Python are used to exeute certain block of code based on specific conditions these statement helps control the flow of a program making it behave differently in defferent siluations.\n",

        "Conditional statment :- if conditional:\n",

        "Q12. How does the elif statement work ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:- The elif statement in python short for else if alloues for the evaluation of multiple conditions in a sequential number it is always used in conjunction with an if statement and can be followed by an optional else statement.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ex:- score = 85\n",

        "                . for loop are desigend for iterateing sequence of item-list etc\n",
        "                . for loop is typicaley uesd for iterating over fixed sequence of items\n",
        "    While loop :- 1 While loops is use to repeat exeute a block of statment uhile a condition a true\n",
        "                  2 while loop used the number of iterations is not know in advance or when use want repet of code.\n",
        "                  3 While loops is used for more complex control flow situations\n",

        "Q14.  Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop ?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ans:- A while loops is more suitable than a for loop in python when the number of iterations is not know in advance and the loops continuation depends on a sepecific condition being met or become fals.\n",
        "       The program cannot pedict now many attempts the user will need to enter\n",
        "Valid input for loop which typically iterates over a know sequence or a defined range would be inappropriate here.\n",
